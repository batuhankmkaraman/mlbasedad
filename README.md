Code for the paper _Machine learning based multi-modal prediction of future decline toward Alzheimer’s disease: An empirical study_

In this paper, we present an empirical study to characterize how predictable individual subjects’ future Alzheimer's Disease trajectory is, several years in advance, based on rich multi-modal data, and using modern deep learning methods.
